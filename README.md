# CongestionPricingChicago
I developed a congestion pricing model for the city of Chicago, Illinois. The simulation finds the 10% most congested roads (based on number of cars that pass the road each day, and average speed of cars (mph) in each of the 1000 street segments), and develops a street pricing with a base rate of $1.00.
